# Basic Python and NLP Billing System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based Billing System** using Python. The system allows users to input product details (name, quantity, price) in a natural language format, and it automatically generates a structured, formatted bill.

## Key Features
- Text Parsing: The system uses NLP techniques to extract product names, quantities, and prices from user input.
- Automated Calculations: Calculates total price and displays itemized billing information.
- Formatted Output: The bill is presented in a structured format for easy readability.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For implementing the logic of the billing system.
- NLP: To process the text input and extract relevant data (product names, quantities, prices).
- Regular Expressions: Used for detecting patterns in the input text (e.g., extracting product names and prices).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/leena920-spec/Lab-1-Basic-Python-and-NLP-Billing-System.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the billing system by executing the Python script:
    ```bash
    python billing_system.py
    ```
